## Goals

### Overarching Product Goal
We defined our overarching goal for this product as: 
"To increase donations to Manchester's homeless community and to raise awareness surrounding the causes of homelessness."

### Sprint Goal
Our goal for this sprint was to create an app that would allow users to scan a QR code. This would then open a web app that would allow them to read the stories of homeless people. We would also set up 'fake door' donation buttons, to test if people would want to use our app to donate to homeless charities before we built this functioality. 

### Learning Goals 
* We wanted to have fully working backend and frontend code
* We wanted to build our backend with MongoDB and the frontend with React
* We wanted to have an excellent UX design, and learn how to use Figma

## Product Vision
* To get people to think more about homelessness and donate more. Not just homelessness generally, but how people become homeless
* To raise awareness and challenge stigma around homelessness, including invisible homelessness
* To eventually have people downloading the 'Pollen' App
* To engender a culture of giving regular donations (which would be the focus of the app in the future, not the website itself)

## Our Story

### Day 1: Tuesday 20th April 2021

Today was our first day dedicated to our build week project. We started with sprint planning, which we timeboxed to 2 hours.

Edwin and Madhura got the backend up and running. They used MongoDBto query the database. Then they hosted the backend on Heroku.

Charly created the front end app with React, and built out some basic components including the Header, StoryList, Footer, NavBar, ErrorDisplay and Loader, etc. 

Alex designed the wireframes for the app using Figma.

### Day 2: Wednesday 21st April 2021

Madhura, Edwin and Charly spent the first part of the morning mob programming a few bugs in our backend code. 

After Edwin fixed the final few things in the backend, and got it pushed to Heroku we all decided to move on to building out our React components.

Charly worked on maxing requests to our backend API using axios, in order to get the stories directly from our database.

Edwin worked on the Hero feature.

Madhura worked on the sliding bar for our Donation Component.

After finishing up her beautiful designs for our landing page, Alex moved on to designing the story page.

### Day 3: Thursday 22nd April 2021

We started the day feeling happy with our progress, and confident that we'd reach our MVP and be able to move on to some 'nice to have features' such as the QR code.

After finishing the designs, Alex started work on our presentation for Monday. 

Madhura continued working on the sliding feature within the Donation Component.

Edwin built out the Charity section, the Burger Menu, and defined some break points.

Charly finished working on the Carousel Component, then moved on to styling the StoryArticle, StoryCard and AboutUs components.

### Day 4: Friday 23rd April 2021

During our morning stand-up, we agreed that we would work on features until 3pm. This was to give us time to host the final version on Netlify and work on our presentation.

Edwin implemented the Artist Components and a QR Scanner component.

Charly re-worked the Story Page Component and added to the AboutUs component page, then redeployed the final build of the project

Alex set up some analytics to track app usage, and continued working on our presentation.

Madhura worked on making the Slider Component responsive. 

### Day 5: Monday 26th April 2021

Today was our final day of build week! In the morning, we practiced our presentation and fine-tuned the last few things in our project.

At 11am, we presented our build week project to ANDi's from the clubs we will be joining (Murray, Sparck and Jemison).

After lunch, we had our Sprint Retro. Then we finished the day with a celebration for all our hard work, and to bring our ANDuction to a close.

## Challenges

* We encountered a few small isues when hosting our backend, which were tricky to de-bug
* CSS styling took a lot longer than we anticipated
* Picking up React as a new technology 

## Successes

* We had a really fun week building out our project. We set out with a clear vision of what we wanted to achieve, and how we would achieve it. Then we worked hard to get there
* We loved using React for the frontend

## What we would do differently next time

* We would write unit tests for the backend up front
* We would have pre-agreed on CSS styling before embarking on the project
