## Our Story

### Day 1: Tuesday 20th April 2021

Today was our first day dedicated to our build week project. We started with sprint planning, which we timeboxed to 2 hours.

Edwin and Madhura got the backend up and running. They used MongoDBto query the database. Then they hosted the backend on Heroku.

Charly created the front end app with React, and built out some basic components including the Header, StoryList, Footer, NavBar, ErrorDisplay and Loader, etc. 

Alex designed the wireframes for the app using Figma.
